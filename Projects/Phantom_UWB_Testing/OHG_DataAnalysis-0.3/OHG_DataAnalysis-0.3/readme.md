# OHG05_DataAnalysis
* Here are Matlab tools to analyze UWB radar data. These files originated in OHG03, but were never put into GitHub during that project.

## Description
* This project is to support MIDI in the development of the new UWB board and to work with bringing new algorithms online. 

* List of important folders/files and brief description
* e.x.: 1. Utilities: common functionalities used accross sample projects]

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* These tools have been tested under Matlab 2023a. The data of 30May2023 have been analyzed. Additional data directories should be looked at.
* It is recommended that a requirments file is included that sets up an environment or provides requirements information for future users.
